## Add custom source

The CS Calculator 2.0 can perform calculations with it's pre-built sources, as well as with custom user-inputted sources. To add a custom source:

1. Click on the **Add Custom Source** icon in the **Source List** panel.

   <Img

     alt="add source icon"
     width={859}
     height={448}
   />

2. The **Add Custom Source** modal will appear.

     width={812}
     height={815}
   />

3. Fill in the **Source Name**, **Manufacturer**, **CCT/Color**, **Lamp Type**, **Description**, and **SPD** input fields.

<AlertBox color="blue">
  <b>Tip:</b> only the Source Name and SPD fields are required. The other fields
  are only used for filtering and organization.
</AlertBox>

The **Source Name** field:

- Must be unique from any of the other sources.

The **SPD** field:

- Will accept relative or absolute SPD's, and convert them automatically to relative.
- Will accept any range of wavelengths, but will ultimately cut off anything outside the range 0nm <= wavelength <= 730nm.
- Will accept any wavelength step size.
- Must contain at least three data points.
- Must contain the same number of wavelengths and values.
