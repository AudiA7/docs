## Light and Health Alliance

The Light and Health Alliance is a collaboration among Members (manufacturers, government organizations and NGOs, codes and standards bodies) and practitioners, including architects, specifiers, medical facility managers and physicians, to enable the broad adoption of lighting for human health by producing factual information grounded in basic and applied research and by visualizing future applications.
