# Authoring

## MDX

These docs are written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), or more specifically [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). More on MDX later.

### Markdown

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the worldâ€™s most popular markup languages.

Each of the individual pages in this website is written in markdown. Markdown provides a very simple authoring experience, allowing us to write documentation pages fast, without the need to program any html/css/js.

```md
## This is a heading

This is a paragraph with a [link](https://www.google.com). This paragraph also contains lists:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

- Item
- Item
- Item
```

Markdown supports headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, links, and more.

To learn how to write markdown, visit [markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/) or see Adam Pritchard's [Markdown Cheatseat](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#emphasis).

### Markdown extensions

[docs.light-health.org](https://docs.light-health.org) also supports a few markdown extensions empowered via [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) and [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark).

#### KaTeX

[KaTeX](https://katex.org/) is a math typesetting library, which allows us to write [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) flavored text directly into our markdown.

```md
$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty\hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}\,d\xi
$$
```

#### Prism

[Prism](https://prismjs.com/) is a syntax highlighter which will highlight our markdown code blocks for us.

````md
```jsx
export default function Books() {
  return (
    <Image src={logistics} width={400} height={400} alt="Man moving boxes" />
  );
}
```
````

### Custom components

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (.mdx) is an extension of markdown which allows us to author custom react components into our markdown. This essentially allows for limitless customizability in our markdown.

For a full list of available custom markdown components, see [COMPONENTS.md](./COMPONENTS.md).

To request a new custom markdown component, or to create your own, see [CONTRIBUTING.ms](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Frontmatter

Frontmatter is the bit at the top of markdown file which provides us with some metadata.

```md
---
title: "Charts"
desc: "A deep dive into the charts panel of the CS Calculator 2.0"
---
```

The website uses this metadata to organize files, provide search, title pages, etc.
